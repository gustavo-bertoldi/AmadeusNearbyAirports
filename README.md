# Nearby airports

This prototype is a simple app allowing you to find nearby airports to a point defined by latitude and longitude. This is a good example of hw to implement the pagination feature available  on selected APIs.
The app uses the Amadeus Node SDK in the backend and the **Airport Nearest Relevant** API, that supports pagination.

## Run locally
```bash
